# Haiilo - Code Challenge
### Position: iOS Developer

We're glad that you're considering a position here at Haiilo. Thank you for taking this code challenge with us.

### About the app
* It is working meaning It compiles and the unit tests pass. 
* The App loads Posts and Users from a sample data source on the internet
* The UI is built using SwiftUI

### The challenge
* This app is purposely badly implemented and it has many quality and performance problems.

### Your task 
* Find problems in the code or test quality. 
* Think about code smells "Smells are certain structures in the code that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality". 
* Modify the code or test to improve these problems.

### What you can do
* Modify, create or delete new files, variables or functions.
* Modify, create or delete new test files or test cases.
* Modify, create or delete new UI files.
* Use the internet anytime to consult language syntax and documentation.
* You can also add new libraries to show your knowledge but don't rely heavily on them

### Deliverable
* We need you to submit a PR with your proposed changes to make the app better.
* Please add comments attached to the code on the PR explaining why you did certain things

### Notes
* We like code that is simple, but [simple is different from easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).
* Keep in mind the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) when doing the project.
* Testing is very important for us. Even if you don't write a single test (for instance, because of time constraints), your app should be easy to test.
* Error scenarios should be taken into consideration and it should be easy to add them, even if you don't explicitly handle them.
* You can use any third-party libraries you wish, but be prepared to justify why you did so (don't forget that we want to evaluate **YOUR** skills). If so, please use a dependency manager.
* **Be consistent in your code**. We advise using something like [GitHub's Swift style guide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide) while doing the code changes. It's absolutely fine to use any other style, as long as you are consistent.
